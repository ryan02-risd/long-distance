        Modern <i>(communication)</i> technologies have changed people’s interaction patterns. They have made it easier to maintain relationships over distances, and more and more social interactions are nowadays mediated by communication media: ‘The advent of modernity increasingly tears space away from place by fostering relations between ‘absent’ others, locationally distant from any given situation of face-to-face interaction’ <i>(Giddens 1990, p. 18)</i>. Relationships in modern societies are no longer confined to people living in the same village. Instead, the networks of people are dispersed and loosely knit, and many relationships are maintained with the help of trans- portation <i>(cars, planes)</i> and new communication technologies <i>(Wellman & Gulia 1999)</i>. Even before the Internet, many relationships have been sustained by media – mainly letters and the phone. Letters and phone calls can easily bridge geographical boundaries, but asynchronous forms of computer- mediated communication <i>(CMC)</i> such as email constitute a fundamental improvement. They are distance-independent not only in use but also in cost; the messages are delivered rapidly, almost in real-time; and the com- munication is unobtrusive because of its asynchronous nature. Communi- cation partners do not have to coordinate their time schedules to be able to interact <i>(Boase & Wellman 2005)</i>. Modern communication technologies have become so widespread that the boundaries between online and offline contacts have blurred. People communicate with most friends, family members and colleagues not exclusively face to face <i>(FTF)</i>, but also via the phone, email or other media; likewise, contacts with friends made online often lead to FTF encounters <i>(Parks & Roberts 1998; Wellman & Gulia 1999; Whitty & Gavin 2001)</i>. 
In view of this development, the central question of this paper is not whether media can be used to maintain friendships, but which media people use to maintain friendships or, more specifically, which media people use to maintain long-distance friendships. Study 1 was exploratory and focused on email use among young Dutch adults, whereas Study 2 replicated and extended the findings of Study 1 in a more heterogeneous sample and focused more explicitly on the comparison between email and phone communication. 
Long-distance friendships are a specific type of interpersonal relation- ships. They are less intimate than romantic relationships, and less task- oriented than work relationships. Many long-distance friendships have evolved from local friendships – they have turned into long-distance friend- ships when at least one of the friends has moved to another place for study, work or personal reasons. Thus, impression formation and relationship build- ing are not the central issues; the goal is mainly relationship maintenance. 
Prior research has dealt with the question of whether it is possible to build up friendships via CMC at all and how friendships develop online <i>(Walther 1992; Utz 2000; McKenna et al. 2002)</i> and has compared the quality of online and offline friendships <i>(Parks & Floyd 1996; Parks & Roberts 1998; Cummings et al. 2002)</i>. However, the question of whether it is possible to build and maintain ‘real’ friendships via email is not the same as the question as to which media people actually use in social relationships. Studies on media use have mainly been conducted in an organ- izational context <i>(Daft & Lengel 1986; Schmitz & Fulk 1991; Markus 1994; Fulk et al. 1995; Haythornthwaite & Wellman 1998)</i>. If they have focused on interpersonal relationships, they have often assessed media use across all types of relationships <i>(e.g. family members, friends, acquaintances, colleagues; Cummings et al. 2002; Boase et al. 2006)</i> or focused on one specific medium <i>(e.g. Baym et al. 2004)</i>. This makes it difficult to relate media charac- teristics to the characteristics of a specific interpersonal relationship. There- fore, the present paper examines media use within one specific type of interpersonal relationships: long-distance friendships. The primary focus will be on the comparison of the two most frequently used media: email and phone <i>(Baym et al. 2004; Boase et al. 2006)</i>. 
Email vs. phone 
Media choice models assume that media can be characterized on the basis of more or less objective criteria and rank-ordered for example according to their social presence <i>(Short et al. 1976)</i>, media richness <i>(Daft & Lengel 1986)</i>, or subjective perceived richness <i>(Schmitz & Fulk 1991)</i>. People are assumed to choose the medium that fits best with the affordances of the task or type of social interaction. 
One important dimension to characterize media is synchronicity. Syn- chronous media are more close to FTF communication; they require both interaction partners to communicate at the same time. Examples are the phone or chats. A disadvantage of synchronous communication is that it requires coordination of schedules. However, synchronous communication allows the giving and receiving of immediate feedback – an advantage when it comes to the discussion of socio-emotional topics such as problems. Asynchronous communication is independent from space and time. Emails can be read immediately after they have been received, but also minutes, hours, days or even weeks later. Especially in long-distance relationships across time zones or between people with different time schedules this aspect might be important. Asynchronous media lack the possibility of giving immediate feed- back, but they give people the opportunity to carefully compose their mess- ages – an asset for in-depth discussions of problems. McKenna et al. <i>(2002)</i> found that those people who can better disclose their ‘true’ inner self via Internet make also more friends online; and Bargh et al. <i>(2002)</i> found that people actually could better disclose their ‘true’ inner self via Internet than via face-to-face communication. With regard to the aspect of synchroni- city, email should be favored over the phone in long-distance relationships; especially if the distance is large and the time schedules of the interaction partners differ notably <i>(Boase & Wellman 2006)</i>. 
Media differ also on their recordability – i.e. the degree to which the interaction is automatically documented <i>(Hancock et al. 2004)</i>. FTF communi- cation and phone calls are usually not recorded although this is technologically possible. Letters and emails can be re-read, saved and archived easily. Especially in long-distance friendships with less frequent contacts, the record- ability might be perceived as an advantage; consequently, email should be favored over the phone. 
An often used dimension to characterize media is the number of channels – FTF communication is then perceived as the richest medium because it transmits information on all channels: audio, video, touch. In phone com- munication, touch and visual cues are filtered out, and CMC is reduced to verbal communication. The same rank order is proposed for social presence, that is the degree of salience of the presence of another person. With regard to friends who already know each other, cues regarding age, gender and appearance are not important. Gesticulation, mime and intonation, however, are helpful cues to judge the mood and emotions of the interaction partner and support so intimate communication. In line with this argumenta- tion, Whitty & Gavin <i>(2001)</i> report that switching from online communi- cation to phone calls is often perceived as a more intimate step in the development of the relationship. According to this logic, the phone should be more appropriate for intimate communication than email. 
More important than these objective media characteristics is how people actually perceive media <i>(Fulk et al. 1995; Schmitz & Fulk 1991)</i>. Several studies have dealt with this question. Dimmick et al. <i>(2000)</i> examined the gratification niches of email and phone. Forty-eight percent of their respon- dents indicated that they use the phone less since they adopted email, indicat- ing that the two media compete. Email was found to be superior to the telephone for keeping in touch with people who lived far away and in different time zones. However, the phone had the broadest niche on the sociability dimension. The first finding refers to the advantages of asynchronicity, the second to the number of channels and therefore the degree of social presence/media richness. 
Cummings et al. <i>(2002)</i> report the results of a survey of 979 employees of a national bank, and another one among 39 students – in both studies, email was judged as less useful for relationships than phone and FTF communication. The latter two were not significantly different from each other. In another study by Baym et al. <i>(2004)</i> the quality of FTF and phone communication was judged as higher than the quality of Internet communication. This differ- ence was not very large, and Internet interactions were still perceived as high in quality. Nevertheless, CMC was judged primarily as ‘particularly useful in maintaining long-distance relationships’ <i>(p. 314)</i>. 
Even if people consider the phone as more suitable for maintaining relationships, this does not necessarily mean that they use it more often 
than email. Media richness theory has proposed that people choose media according to their task-media fit <i>(Daft & Lengel 1984, 1986)</i>, but empirical research has shown that people often do not act as rational actors <i>(cf. Rice & Shook 1990)</i>. Several studies found that email predominates in long- distance relationships, especially in weak ties <i>(Hampton & Wellman 2001; Quan-Haase et al. 2002; Boase & Wellman 2006)</i>. Based on these studies it can be expected that email is used more frequently than the phone in long-distance friendships. 
However, a recent study on media use of American teens revealed that the phone – the landline phone or the cellphone – is still the central medium of communication in daily life <i>(Lenhart et al. 2005)</i>. Thus, prior research reveals somewhat mixed results with regard to the preference of media. One reason for these discrepancies might be the different samples – teens, students, or respondents selected by random digit dialing. Another reason for these discrepancies might be the focus on media use across different situations and different relationships <i>(Dimmick et al. 2000; Cummings et al. 2002)</i>. This makes it difficult to draw inferences specifically about media use in long-distance friendships. 
Two studies deal with similar questions to those in the current paper. Haythornthwaite <i>(2000)</i> examined what happens to relationships when FTF communication is unavailable or limited. However, this study looked at class- mates in a distance-learning class, that is, a more task-oriented type of relationship. The theoretical background of the study was social network analysis; therefore, the comparison between weak and strong ties was central. Pairs of students with stronger ties used more media, and they used email more than the phone. However, in case of a task-orientated working relationship, email is also the medium that fits better with the affordances of the task. Documents can be attached, and agreements are documented and can easily be archived. Thus, there is no inherent conflict between conven- ience of the medium and task-medium fit; consequently, the preference for email is not really surprising. Baym et al. <i>(2004)</i> focused on interpersonal com- munication via Internet, the phone and FTF. In the first study reported in the paper, college students kept a diary about media use in their ongoing daily life. Most interactions were FTF, and there were slightly more phone calls <i>(18.4 percent)</i> than Internet interactions <i>(16.1 percent)</i>. However, type of relation- ship has not been specified in this analysis. In the second study, the relative use of three media <i>(FTF, phone, Internet)</i> in four types of relationships <i>(acquain- tances, friends, family members, partners)</i> was examined. However, the design was between-subjects. That is, there were 12 different versions of the questionnaire, and people evaluated only the last interaction via the respective medium. Unfortunately, there are no data available concerning the preference for email or the phone in this specific type of relationship. Instead, it was assessed which media participants used to communicate with members of their local and distant <i>(close)</i> social circles. Internet was used more often in communication with members of distant circles than with members of local circles. More importantly, within distant social circles <i>(close and less close ones)</i>, the phone was used somewhat, but not significantly, more than Internet communication. However, the circles averaged communi- cation with relatives, friends and work colleagues, and the question was with what percentage of the respective circle they communicated at least some- times via Internet, FTF, phone and mail. That is not the same as the question as to what percentage of their communication within a specific relationship was conducted via a specific medium. Thus, it is not possible to say which media people actually use to what extent in long-distance friendships. The main aim of Study 1 is to answer this question.
