            Modern <i>(communication)</i> technologies have changed people’s interaction patterns. They have made it easier to maintain relationships over distances, and more and more social interactions are nowadays mediated by communication media: ‘The advent of modernity increasingly tears space away from place by fostering relations between ‘absent’ others, locationally distant from any given situation of face-to-face interaction’ <i>(Giddens 1990, p. 18)</i>. Relationships in modern societies are no longer confined to people living in the same village. Instead, the networks of people are dispersed and loosely knit, and many relationships are maintained with the help of trans- portation <i>(cars, planes)</i> and new communication technologies <i>(Wellman & Gulia 1999)</i>. Even before the Internet, many relationships have been sustained by media – mainly letters and the phone. Letters and phone calls can easily bridge geographical boundaries, but asynchronous forms of computer- mediated communication <i>(CMC)</i> such as email constitute a fundamental improvement. They are distance-independent not only in use but also in cost; the messages are delivered rapidly, almost in real-time; and the com- munication is unobtrusive because of its asynchronous nature. Communi- cation partners do not have to coordinate their time schedules to be able to interact <i>(Boase & Wellman 2005)</i>. Modern communication technologies have become so widespread that the boundaries between online and offline contacts have blurred. People communicate with most friends, family members and colleagues not exclusively face to face <i>(FTF)</i>, but also via the phone, email or other media; likewise, contacts with friends made online often lead to FTF encounters <i>(Parks & Roberts 1998; Wellman & Gulia 1999; Whitty & Gavin 2001)</i>.              In view of this development, the central question of this paper is not whether media can be used to maintain friendships, but which media people use to maintain friendships or, more specifically, which media people use to maintain long-distance friendships. Study 1 was exploratory and focused on email use among young Dutch adults, whereas Study 2 replicated and extended the findings of Study 1 in a more heterogeneous sample and focused more explicitly on the comparison between email and phone communication.              Long-distance friendships are a specific type of interpersonal relation- ships. They are less intimate than romantic relationships, and less task- oriented than work relationships. Many long-distance friendships have evolved from local friendships – they have turned into long-distance friend- ships when at least one of the friends has moved to another place for study, work or personal reasons. Thus, impression formation and relationship build- ing are not the central issues; the goal is mainly relationship maintenance.              Prior research has dealt with the question of whether it is possible to build up friendships via CMC at all and how friendships develop online <i>(Walther 1992; Utz 2000; McKenna et al. 2002)</i> and has compared the quality of online and offline friendships <i>(Parks & Floyd 1996; Parks & Roberts 1998; Cummings et al. 2002)</i>. However, the question of whether it is possible to build and maintain ‘real’ friendships via email is not the same as the question as to which media people actually use in social relationships. Studies on media use have mainly been conducted in an organ- izational context <i>(Daft & Lengel 1986; Schmitz & Fulk 1991; Markus 1994; Fulk et al. 1995; Haythornthwaite & Wellman 1998)</i>. If they have focused on interpersonal relationships, they have often assessed media use across all types of relationships <i>(e.g. family members, friends, acquaintances, colleagues; Cummings et al. 2002; Boase et al. 2006)</i> or focused on one specific medium <i>(e.g. Baym et al. 2004)</i>. This makes it difficult to relate media charac- teristics to the characteristics of a specific interpersonal relationship. There- fore, the present paper examines media use within one specific type of interpersonal relationships: long-distance friendships. The primary focus will be on the comparison of the two most frequently used media: email and phone <i>(Baym et al. 2004; Boase et al. 2006)</i>.              Email vs. phone              Media choice models assume that media can be characterized on the basis of more or less objective criteria and rank-ordered for example according to their social presence <i>(Short et al. 1976)</i>, media richness <i>(Daft & Lengel 1986)</i>, or subjective perceived richness <i>(Schmitz & Fulk 1991)</i>. People are assumed to choose the medium that fits best with the affordances of the task or type of social interaction.              One important dimension to characterize media is synchronicity. Syn- chronous media are more close to FTF communication; they require both interaction partners to communicate at the same time. Examples are the phone or chats. A disadvantage of synchronous communication is that it requires coordination of schedules. However, synchronous communication allows the giving and receiving of immediate feedback – an advantage when it comes to the discussion of socio-emotional topics such as problems. Asynchronous communication is independent from space and time. Emails can be read immediately after they have been received, but also minutes, hours, days or even weeks later. Especially in long-distance relationships across time zones or between people with different time schedules this aspect might be important. Asynchronous media lack the possibility of giving immediate feed- back, but they give people the opportunity to carefully compose their mess- ages – an asset for in-depth discussions of problems. McKenna et al. <i>(2002)</i> found that those people who can better disclose their ‘true’ inner self via Internet make also more friends online; and Bargh et al. <i>(2002)</i> found that people actually could better disclose their ‘true’ inner self via Internet than via face-to-face communication. With regard to the aspect of synchroni- city, email should be favored over the phone in long-distance relationships; especially if the distance is large and the time schedules of the interaction partners differ notably <i>(Boase & Wellman 2006)</i>.              Media differ also on their recordability – i.e. the degree to which the interaction is automatically documented <i>(Hancock et al. 2004)</i>. FTF communi- cation and phone calls are usually not recorded although this is technologically possible. Letters and emails can be re-read, saved and archived easily. Especially in long-distance friendships with less frequent contacts, the record- ability might be perceived as an advantage; consequently, email should be favored over the phone.              An often used dimension to characterize media is the number of channels – FTF communication is then perceived as the richest medium because it transmits information on all channels: audio, video, touch. In phone com- munication, touch and visual cues are filtered out, and CMC is reduced to verbal communication. The same rank order is proposed for social presence, that is the degree of salience of the presence of another person. With regard to friends who already know each other, cues regarding age, gender and appearance are not important. Gesticulation, mime and intonation, however, are helpful cues to judge the mood and emotions of the interaction partner and support so intimate communication. In line with this argumenta- tion, Whitty & Gavin <i>(2001)</i> report that switching from online communi- cation to phone calls is often perceived as a more intimate step in the development of the relationship. According to this logic, the phone should be more appropriate for intimate communication than email.              More important than these objective media characteristics is how people actually perceive media <i>(Fulk et al. 1995; Schmitz & Fulk 1991)</i>. Several studies have dealt with this question. Dimmick et al. <i>(2000)</i> examined the gratification niches of email and phone. Forty-eight percent of their respon- dents indicated that they use the phone less since they adopted email, indicat- ing that the two media compete. Email was found to be superior to the telephone for keeping in touch with people who lived far away and in different time zones. However, the phone had the broadest niche on the sociability dimension. The first finding refers to the advantages of asynchronicity, the second to the number of channels and therefore the degree of social presence/media richness.              Cummings et al. <i>(2002)</i> report the results of a survey of 979 employees of a national bank, and another one among 39 students – in both studies, email was judged as less useful for relationships than phone and FTF communication. The latter two were not significantly different from each other. In another study by Baym et al. <i>(2004)</i> the quality of FTF and phone communication was judged as higher than the quality of Internet communication. This differ- ence was not very large, and Internet interactions were still perceived as high in quality. Nevertheless, CMC was judged primarily as ‘particularly useful in maintaining long-distance relationships’ <i>(p. 314)</i>.              Even if people consider the phone as more suitable for maintaining relationships, this does not necessarily mean that they use it more often              than email. Media richness theory has proposed that people choose media according to their task-media fit <i>(Daft & Lengel 1984, 1986)</i>, but empirical research has shown that people often do not act as rational actors <i>(cf. Rice & Shook 1990)</i>. Several studies found that email predominates in long- distance relationships, especially in weak ties <i>(Hampton & Wellman 2001; Quan-Haase et al. 2002; Boase & Wellman 2006)</i>. Based on these studies it can be expected that email is used more frequently than the phone in long-distance friendships.              However, a recent study on media use of American teens revealed that the phone – the landline phone or the cellphone – is still the central medium of communication in daily life <i>(Lenhart et al. 2005)</i>. Thus, prior research reveals somewhat mixed results with regard to the preference of media. One reason for these discrepancies might be the different samples – teens, students, or respondents selected by random digit dialing. Another reason for these discrepancies might be the focus on media use across different situations and different relationships <i>(Dimmick et al. 2000; Cummings et al. 2002)</i>. This makes it difficult to draw inferences specifically about media use in long-distance friendships.              Two studies deal with similar questions to those in the current paper. Haythornthwaite <i>(2000)</i> examined what happens to relationships when FTF communication is unavailable or limited. However, this study looked at class- mates in a distance-learning class, that is, a more task-oriented type of relationship. The theoretical background of the study was social network analysis; therefore, the comparison between weak and strong ties was central. Pairs of students with stronger ties used more media, and they used email more than the phone. However, in case of a task-orientated working relationship, email is also the medium that fits better with the affordances of the task. Documents can be attached, and agreements are documented and can easily be archived. Thus, there is no inherent conflict between conven- ience of the medium and task-medium fit; consequently, the preference for email is not really surprising. Baym et al. <i>(2004)</i> focused on interpersonal com- munication via Internet, the phone and FTF. In the first study reported in the paper, college students kept a diary about media use in their ongoing daily life. Most interactions were FTF, and there were slightly more phone calls <i>(18.4 percent)</i> than Internet interactions <i>(16.1 percent)</i>. However, type of relation- ship has not been specified in this analysis. In the second study, the relative use of three media <i>(FTF, phone, Internet)</i> in four types of relationships <i>(acquain- tances, friends, family members, partners)</i> was examined. However, the design was between-subjects. That is, there were 12 different versions of the questionnaire, and people evaluated only the last interaction via the respective medium. Unfortunately, there are no data available concerning the preference for email or the phone in this specific type of relationship. Instead, it was assessed which media participants used to communicate with members of their local and distant <i>(close)</i> social circles. Internet was used more often in communication with members of distant circles than with members of local circles. More importantly, within distant social circles <i>(close and less close ones)</i>, the phone was used somewhat, but not significantly, more than Internet communication. However, the circles averaged communi- cation with relatives, friends and work colleagues, and the question was with what percentage of the respective circle they communicated at least some- times via Internet, FTF, phone and mail. That is not the same as the question as to what percentage of their communication within a specific relationship was conducted via a specific medium. Thus, it is not possible to say which media people actually use to what extent in long-distance friendships. The main aim of Study 1 is to answer this question.RQ1: Which media do people use to what extent in long-distance friendships?  An open research question is formulated because contrasting predictions can be derived. On the one hand it can be argued that most of the communi- cation in a long-distance friendship will be conducted via email because email makes it easy to bridge large distances and even time zones. Even within the same time zone, email fits better in the time schedules of both communication partners. An email can be sent at any time, even late at night, when it might be impolite to call. Thus, if people choose media according to their conven- ience, a high proportion of communication in long-distance friendships should take place via email.  On the one hand it can be argued that most of the communication in a long-distance friendship will be conducted via phone because the phone is the richer medium more suited for intimate communication (Whitty & Gavin 2001). Thus, if people choose media according to their richness, a high proportion of communication in long-distance friendships should take place via the phone.  Additional factors, which might influence media choice, are taken into account as well. Studies on media choice have revealed that people are not rational actors that choose media according to their appropriateness in a different situation (Rice & Shook 1990; Markus 1994). Fulk and colleagues (1995; Schmitz & Fulk 1991) suggested that perceived media richness is a better predictor of actual media use than objective media richness. They examined email use in organizations and found that email use is predicted by email skills and perceived email richness. The same should hold true for media choice in interpersonal settings, leading to the following hypotheses:  H1: The higher the email skills, the more the email use.H2: The higher the perceived email richness, the more the email use.  Perceived email richness refers to the usefulness of email to express socio-emotional contents. According to the social information processing perspective (Walther 1992), it is possible to verbalize socio-emotional con- tents and compensate for the lack of nonverbal cues (Utz 2000). However, another factor that might be important for the maintenance of interpersonal relationships is immediacy of feedback. Therefore, it was also assessed how important immediate feedback was for participants. It was expected that people who do not attach much importance to immediate feedback show a stronger preference for email communication.  H3: The lower the importance of immediate feedback, the more the email use.  Additionally, it was expected that the availability of Internet access influences email use.  H4: The higher the availability of Internet access, the more the email use.  These hypotheses were tested in a survey among young Dutch adolescents (aged 20–35). In this phase of life, many people move to another town because they go to university or start their first job. Additionally, this age group is familiar with new communication media.  Study 1: Method  Procedure  A questionnaire was sent via email to young Dutch adults. The respondents were asked to think of a friend who lives in another place and to answer the subsequent questions with regard to communication with this specific person.  Measures  Media use. People were presented with a list of seven communication modes (FTF, phone, email, SMS, chat/IM, letters, other) and asked to indicate what percentage of their communication with their friend was covered by the seven categories. Additionally, the absolute number of emails exchanged with the friend per month was assessed. The content of their emails was to be judged on a five-point scale ranging from ‘very superficial’ to ‘very intimate’.  Characteristics of the friendship. Distance, duration of the friendships, and closeness of the friendship (five-point-scale) were measured.  Accessibility/costsofemail. ParticipantswereaskedaboutthetypeofInternet connection (modem, broadband, etc.; at home, at work, etc.) and whether they had to pay for their Internet connection themselves.  Emailskills. Emailskillswereassessedbytwoitems,typingskillsandspecific email skills (a 1⁄4 0.73). Answers were given on a five-point-scale ranging from 1 1⁄4 very bad to 5 1⁄4 very good. Perceived email richness and importance of immediate feedback were measured on five-point-scales (1 1⁄4 totally disagree, 5 1⁄4 totally agree). Perceived email richness was assessed by four items (e.g. ‘I can express my personal feelings well in email’; a 1⁄4 0.70). The scale import- ance of immediate feedback had four items (e.g. ‘I think it is a disadvantage that I do not receive an immediate answer from my friend’; a 1⁄4 0.70).  Demographic characteristics. Participants were asked to indicate their age, gender, and education level.  Participants  Eighty-three young adults participated in the survey. Two-thirds of the sample were female, the average age was 24 years (range 20 – 35). Most of the friends (56 percent) were separated by more than 50 kilometers, and 43 percent of the friendships had lasted longer than five years. The mean friendship intensity was relatively high, M 1⁄4 4.03 (SD 1⁄4 0.67) on a five-point scale.  Results  Media use  Email turned out to be the preferred medium in long-distance friendships: 31 percent of the communication was done via email, followed by FTF (27 percent), phone (22 percent) and chat/IM (11 percent). SMS, letters and other communication media were used barely. Email use was not significantly higher than FTF communication, t(83) , 1, n.s., but email use was signifi- cantly higher than phone use, t(83) 1⁄4 2.31, p , 0.05. The mean number of emails was M 1⁄4 6.77 (SD 1⁄4 6.82), and the content of the emails was judged as neither superficial nor very intimate, M 1⁄4 3.28 (SD 1⁄4 0.83).  Influence factors  Forty-three percent of the participants reported that they and their friend had email access at home and at work/university, and only 7 percent reported that one of them had only restricted Internet access. Participants estimated their email skills as high, M 1⁄4 4.17 (SD 1⁄4 0.57. Perceived email richness was regarded as moderate, M1⁄43.45 (SD1⁄40.52), and the importance of immediate feedback was relatively neutral, M 1⁄4 3.12 (SD 1⁄4 0.66). Email skills correlated with perceived email richness, r(83) 1⁄4 0.41, p , 0.01.  Separate regression analyses with percentage of email communication and absolute number of emails written per month as criterion variable and accessibility, costs, perceived email richness and importance of immediate feedback as predictors revealed no significant results, both Fs (5,72) , 1. Hypotheses 1–4 were therefore rejected.  Additional findings  Exploratory data analysis revealed that the absolute and relative number of emails were independent of each other, r(80) 1⁄4 20.08, n.s. To further explore this initially unexpected finding, the influence of friendship closeness on email use was examined. There was a positive correlation between close- ness and absolute number of emails exchanged per month, r(77) 1⁄4 0.24, p , 0.05, but a negative correlation between friendship closeness and rela- tive number of emails per month, r(77) 1⁄4 20.22, p , 0.05.  Discussion  Email is indeed the most frequently used medium in long-distance friendships – at least among young Dutch adults. Despite the phone’s ability to transmit nonverbal socio-emotional cues such as intonation and to provide immediate feedback, email is chosen over the phone. Instant messenger, which is very popular with American teens (Lenhart et al. 2005), has not reached this level of popularity in the Netherlands.  Interestingly, neither objective (accessibility of an Internet connection, costs) nor subjective (perceived email richness, importance of immediate feed- back) factors predicted email use. These results might partly be due to ceiling effects – most people had a broadband Internet connection at home and at uni- versity/work, and email skills were estimated as high. It remains surprising that importance of immediate feedback and email richness did not influence actual email usage. Obviously, people choose email more for convenience reasons – email is available and does not interrupt the friend’s time schedule.  There was an unpredicted finding – absolute and relative number of emails were independent of each other. Closeness of friendship turned out to be a mod- erating factor. The positive correlation between friendship closeness and absol- ute number of emails exchanged might be explained by the fact that in close friendships more communication takes place (Boase et al. 2006; Haythornthwaite 2000; Haythornthwaite & Wellman 1998). The negative correlation between closeness and percentage of email communication would then indicate that – even if the overall amount of communication is higher in close friendships – email is less preferred in close friendships. Thus, despite the fact that email is used most frequently in long-distance friendships, it might be regarded as less suitable for the maintenance of close friendships. Con- sequently, it should be used especially among acquaintances, but less so among best friends. There was a positive correlation between closeness and percentage of phone communication, r(77) 1⁄4 0.25, p , 0.05, which would support the post-hoc explanation that richer media are preferred in closer friendships.  Another indicator that email might be a convenient, but not the most suitable communication medium for the maintenance of friendships, is that the content of the emails was not judged as intimate. This fact is puzzling because emotional intimacy usually characterizes close friendships. Obviously, intimate conversations take place via other media. Unfortunately, the intimateness of the phone calls was not measured in Study 1. Study 2 was designed to compare email and phone communication and to explicitly test these post-hoc explanations.  Study 2  Study 2 aimed to replicate the basic findings of Study 1 in a more heterogeneous sample, thereby examining the generalizability of the results. Moreover, it focused on the comparison of email and phone communication and tested the moderating role of closeness of the friendship. Based on the post-hoc expla- nations of the results of Study 1, the following hypotheses were derived:  H1: Overall, email is preferred over the phone in long-distance friend- ships.H2: The closer the friendship, the more communication overall (in total, but also separately for email and phone).  H3: The closer the friendship, the higher the percentage of phone com- munication.H4: The closer the friendship, the lower the percentage of email communication.  If the phone is preferred over email in very close friendships because it is better suited for the discussion of personal and intimate topics, closeness of friendship should be related mainly to intimateness of the phone conversa- tions, but less so to intimateness of the email conversations.  H5: The closer the friendship, the more intimate the content of the com- munication. H6: The effect predicted in H5 should be more pronounced in phone communication. These hypotheses were tested in an online study among German Internet users. A broader and more heterogeneous sample was used to examine the generalizability of the results of Study 1.
